# About this Blog
This blog is a personal one, in which I will be posting about
miscellaneous subjects that are of interest to me, and hopefully
to many like-minded people.

I have no clear plans yet about the breadth of these subjects,
but they will be mostly about programming, and more specifically,
about computer graphics programming, a subject I am invested in,
at least in an amateur capacity.

## Disclaimer
When it comes to "graphics", I do not claim to be an expert or
an authority on the subject. In fact, I do not have professional
credentials in graphics. However, it is an important interest
to me, and it happened to be the one interest that got e into
programming in the first place, and consequently into a career
in software development.
